**You are designing a multi-Region architecture for a cloud application that requires the use of AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to deploy and manage containerized workloads. How can you deploy an EKS cluster in multiple Regions while minimizing latency and ensuring high availability?**

Use AWS Fargate profiles to deploy containerized workloads in multiple Regions without managing EC2 instances.

Use EKS managed node groups to deploy EKS worker nodes in each Region and ensure the availability of worker nodes.

Use AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic to EKS clusters in different Regions and ensure high availability and low latency.

Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic across EKS clusters in different Regions and ensure low-latency access.

**Correct Answer: Use AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic to EKS clusters in different Regions and ensure high availability and low latency.**
**AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of applications by using a global network of AWS edge locations. It allows you to route traffic to EKS clusters in different Regions and ensures high availability and low latency by automatically directing traffic to the optimal endpoint based on health, geography, and routing policies.**
