**You are designing a highly available, multi-Region architecture for a cloud application that requires the use of Amazon DynamoDB to store and manage data. How can you ensure that DynamoDB tables are replicated and available in all Regions while minimizing latency and cost?**

Use AWS Data Pipeline to schedule data transfer between DynamoDB tables in different Regions.

Use Amazon DynamoDB global tables to automatically replicate data across all Regions and optimize for low latency.

Use Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication to replicate DynamoDB backups to S3 in different Regions.

Use Amazon Aurora Global Database to replicate DynamoDB data to Aurora clusters in different Regions.

**Use Amazon DynamoDB global tables to automatically replicate data across all Regions and optimize for low latency.**
**Amazon DynamoDB global tables is a fully managed service that enables you to replicate tables automatically across multiple Regions with automatic multi-master replication, so all Regions can access the data with low latency. This ensures that the data is highly available and provides low-latency access to the data for applications and users in different Regions.**
